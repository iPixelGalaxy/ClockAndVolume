# ClockAndVolume
A Lighter-Weight Beat Saber Clock and Volume mod based off [Enhancements](https://github.com/auros/enhancements) by Auros!
Adds various extra features into Beat Saber like a clock and volume adjustment!

* Clock: Customizable clock!
* Volume Assistant: Change specific volumes in the game (fireworks volume, menu music volume, hit sound volume, etc)

Some Additions:
- Reset Color button for the clock!
- In-Game different positions. (This is a scuffed implementation where you don't get to see a preview, but trust me bro, it works)

Some of the UI:
